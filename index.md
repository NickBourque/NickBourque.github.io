## Greetings! :wave:

### I’m Nick – a Senior Software Engineer based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

After graduating from Nova Scotia Community College in 2017 and beginning my career at a budding startup, I quickly became the lead developer on a SaaS platform that has gone on to reach tens of thousands of users. Working primarily on a LAMP stack, I spent my first three working years honing my skills in software architecture, PHP, database design, procedural SQL, and JavaScript, to become the developer I am now.

Today, I lead a small engineering team for an international ed-tech company. Together, we help bring online learning to the homes and classrooms of students around the world. I’m proud to be using my expertise to support the production of our educational content, and I’m excited about the evolving challenge that comes with working in a rapidly changing environment.

Currently, I'm responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of an array of mission-critical software systems used to produce and deliver animated video content. From the content-planning stage, through the production of multilingual/multi-locale animations, voiceovers, and closed captioning, our content production pipeline utilizes a complex set of process-management and quality-control tools that are ever-evolving as we work toward increasing automation and scalability.
