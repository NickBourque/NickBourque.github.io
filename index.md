## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

### Iâ€™m Nick â€“ a Software Engineer based in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

After graduating from Nova Scotia Community College in 2017 and beginning my career at a budding startup, I quickly became the lead developer on a SaaS platform that has gone on to reach tens of thousands of users. Working primarily on a LAMP stack, I spent my first three working years honing my skills in software architecture, PHP, database design, procedural SQL, and JavaScript, to become the developer I am now.

In my recent experience, I've lead a small engineering team for an international ed-tech company where I was responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of an array of mission-critical software systems used to produce and deliver animated video content, bringing online learning to the homes and classrooms of students around the world. From the content-planning stage, through the production of multilingual/multi-locale animations, voiceovers, and closed captioning, the content production pipeline I helped develop utilizes a complex set of process-management and quality-control tools that were ever-evolving as we worked toward increasing automation and scalability.

Currently, I'm working with a great team in the XR (i.e. AR & VR) space to develop a product that enables companies large and small to remotely manage AR & VR devices, deploy content, and control what users can see and do in the headset. I'm thrilled to be working with such an incredible team on a product that has the potential to change the way companies in every industry deliver training material to their employees.
