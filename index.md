### About Me

I'm Nick, a Software Engineer based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, passionate about building innovative and impactful software solutions. 

My journey began in 2017 after graduating from Nova Scotia Community College. I quickly found myself leading the development of a SaaS platform at a dynamic startup, where I honed my skills in software architecture, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript, contributing to a product that reached tens of thousands of users.

Driven by a desire to expand my horizons, I transitioned to an international ed-tech company. There, I once again began as an individual contributor and worked my way up to a lead role, where I led a talented engineering team responsible for the development and maintenance of systems that powered the creation and delivery of animated educational content. This experience deepened my understanding of process management, quality control, and the importance of automation and scalability.

Currently, I'm collaborating with an exceptional team in the exciting world of XR. We're developing a cutting-edge product that empowers businesses of all sizes to seamlessly manage AR/VR devices, deploy content, and curate user experiences. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the potential of this technology to revolutionize training and education across industries.

Throughout my career, I've consistently sought opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to projects that make a difference. I'm eager to connect and explore new possibilities in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
